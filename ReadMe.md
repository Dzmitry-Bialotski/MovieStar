This is a web application, that I made as a part of EPAM courses. There are four user roles, that determine possible actions, such as CRUD operations for movies; likes (with AJAX), registration, login, email confirmation, sending star rating or new review to the movie and much more. The project is written adhering to the onion architecture, with a lot of patterns and documentation. There are DAO, Service, Controller + commands, views layers.
